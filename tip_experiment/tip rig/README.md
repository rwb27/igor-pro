### Tip Alignment ###

- Align with piezo DCO on (1) to prevent movement?
- Using 500 points to measure from oscilloscope as this is fastest. Requires a good number of periods on screen to use for fit.
- Tried using tektronix immediate measurement of frequency and pk2pk however the measurement was too slow. Approximately 3 s per point of acquisition.
- Attempt to fit to wave to test alignment
