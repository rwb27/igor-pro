### Tip Alignment ###

- Align with piezo DCO on (1) or off (0) to prevent movement? Off means movement is smooth despite the position reporting being inaccurate. On means movement is not smooth but position may be accurate.
- Using 500 points to measure from oscilloscope is supposedly fastest. 2500 points also proves fast and allows a greater number of periods to be acquired for analysis with greater number of points for accuracy.
- Tried using tektronix immediate measurement of frequency and pk2pk however the measurement was too slow. Approximately 3 s per point of acquisition.
- Attempting to fit to wave to test alignment not tried since at low voltages it does not appear to be a pure sine wave.
